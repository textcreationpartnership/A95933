         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE VINDICATION AND
CLEARING OF Sir IAMES RAMSEY
From thoſe baſe aſperſions caſt upon him through miſ-information, &amp;c.
Concerning his Carriage in the Fight at Kyneton, 23 October 1642.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Olonell <hi>Midleton,</hi> Major <hi>Baylie,</hi> and Major <hi>Melvill,</hi> being ſeverally examined by thoſe whom his Excellence the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Lord Generall
of our Army had appointed to examine the buſineſſe of Sir <hi>James Ramſey</hi> his carriage and behaviour the 23. of <hi>October,</hi> at the fight in <hi>Kineton</hi>
field, doe all unanimouſly agree and depoſe that the ſaid Sir <hi>James,</hi> having the command of the left Wing of our Horſe, did ſo place and
order the ſeverall Squadrons of Horſe of the Wing at beſt advantage for fight, and did place ſeverall Rankes of Muſqueteers betwixt the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons
of Horſe, and interlarded them ſo well for offending of the enemy, and for defending of themſelves, as could be deſired, and did alſo
lay upon the left hand of the Horſe, in a hedge two or three hundred Muſqueteers, for to Flanke the Front of our Horſe, and give fire to
the Enemies at their charging of our Horſe, and all thoſe three above-named Gentlemen affirme that the ſaid Sir <hi>James</hi> did before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
exhort and entreate all the Troopes that ſtood thus imbattailed to ſtand firme, and doe for the honour of their Country and their owne
Reputation, repreſenting to them they were to fight for Gods Cauſe, for Religion, and for liberty of Lawes of the Kingdome, and ſafety of what was deareſt
unto them; withall telling them that they were to fight againſt Gods Enemies, men of no Religion, for the moſt part; Who ſought their owne ends onely, by
the overthrow of the purity of Religion, and liberties and welfare of the Kingdome: yet notwithſtanding all this, they affirme that at the approach of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
our Troopes did diſcharge their long peeces afarre of, and without diſtance, and immediately thereafter wheeled all about, and ranne diſorderly, leaving
the Muſqueteeres to be cut in peeces by the Enemy, ſo did their Officers ſhew them the way, and their Lieutenants; whoſe Captaine were abſent, running away,
told that their place was to bring up the Reere. And Sir <hi>James</hi> himſelfe being ingaged among the Squadrons of the Enemies Horſe, was carryed violently out of
the Field. The verity of which premiſes theſe three Gentlemen doe offer, and are ready to give their oath upon whenſoever they ſhall be required.</p>

               <head>Sir James Ramſey his Declaration.</head>
               <p>AFter I had Orders from his Excellency the Lord Generall of our Army, and others my Superiours, for ordering and commanding the left Wing of the Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery,
I did accordingly put them in Poſture Defenſive, and Offenſive, interlining the Squadrons with a convenient number of Muſqueteeres, and likewiſe did
place three hundred Muſqueteers on a Hedge on the left hand of the left Wing; which did Flanke the whole Front of the left Wing; Thereafter on the head
of every Squadron exhorting them to magnanimity and reſolution, ſhewing them the worth of their Anceſtors, deſiring them to ſhew themſelves worthy ſuch
Noble Progenitors, and putting before them the juſtneſſe of the cauſe, that it was the purity of Religion, the Liberty of the Subject, and the King and Parliaments
Honour, that drew them into the Field, and no mans private Quarrell; and the more to incourage them, I did lay before them the unworthineſſe of the adverſe
party, that they were Papiſts, Atheiſts, and Irreligious perſons for the moſt part; and after deſiring, and heartily exhorting them to give the enemy a brave mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
who were advancing to charge us, and commanding ours to receive them reſolutely; (contrary to my expectation, and to my perpetuall regrate) ours diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their Carbines at a long diſtance, and thereafter baſely runne away, and that in mighty confuſion, ſo that I was ingaged in middle of the enemies Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
and violently borne away out of the field, and ſo was carryed along, two miles at leaſt; being thus among the Enemy in an incloſure, by leaping over a
ditch, none of the enemies being able to follow me, I eſcaped, and then aſſuring my ſelfe we had loſt the day, in reſpect the left wing of ours was altogether rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and a great many of the Infantry on the right wing, with flying colours; I reſolved to goe towards <hi>London,</hi> fearing the Parliament ſhould be miſ-informed
of me, in reſpect that part of the Army I commanded, firſt gave ground to the enemy; Likewiſe knowing my hard condition if I ſhould have beene Priſoner, in
reſpect I came not onely my ſelfe to doe my beſt ſervice to the King and Parliament, (though at this time things have falne out farre contrary to my expectation)
but likewiſe did incite and incourage a great many others, brave Commanders, for the ſame ſervice: And this upon my Conſcience I declare.</p>
